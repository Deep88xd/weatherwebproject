//step 1:
// command: git status// on root folder
//if output is: not a git repository, then initialize git in folder

//step 2:
//git init 

//step 3:
//never upload node_modules on github
//so create a file : .gitignore and add which file you want to ignore.(such as node_modules) just write the name of files/directories.
//what is gitignore ?
//gitignore is a plain text file where each line is contains a pattern for files/directories to ignore. 

//step 4:
git add .

//step 5:
git commit -m "nodejs project first commit"

//step 6:
git config user.email "you@example.com"
git config user.name "Your Name"
git commit -m "nodejs project first commit"

//step 7:
command: git remote , to check remote is already added to the project or not.
git remote maintains git version git is also a remote server.
git remote add origin https://github.com/Deep88xd/weatherwebproject.git

//step 8:
without SSH we can Upload our project using push command but we need to Add SSH.
create SSH key for secure file sharing.

//step 9:
on gitbash command:ls ~/.ssh  , to check remote is already exist in your computer.
if(ssh is not exist){
    command: ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "deepakoraon13454@gmail.com"
//here rsa is the sirname of the author of ssh keygen
//4096: is how much bit you want to give.
//output:
Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/deepa/.ssh/id_rsa):[press enter]
//output:
Created directory '/c/Users/deepa/.ssh'.
}else{
    if there two files exist such as:
     ls ~/.ssh to check remote is already exist in your computer.
     //output:
id_rsa  id_rsa.pub
here _rsa file is private file stay on your computer.
And .pub file is public file upload to the remote computer.

//step 10:
add private file on computer.
command: eval $(ssh-agent -s)
//output
Agent pid 1548
add this key on computer
command: ssh-add -k ~/.ssh/id_rsa
//output
Identity added: /c/Users/deepa/.ssh/id_rsa (deepakoraon13454@gmail.com)
step 11:
add .pub key on github or remoter computer.
command: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
//output
ssh-rsa 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 deepakoraon13454@gmail.com

//paste that code on github setting/ssh-gpg-keys section

step 12:
lets check secure connection is stablished or not , b/w local and remote computer or github
on vs code terminal command: ssh -T git@github.com 
//output
//The authenticity of host 'github.com (13.234.210.38)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:p2QAMXNIC1TJYWeIOttrVc98/R1BUFWu3/LiyKgUfQM.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? [press yes]
//Hi Deep88xd! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
}

step 13:
//check github repo branch
command:git branch
*master
//push code to github
command:git push -u origin main/master

step 14:

after push files to github if we want to update file to comupter and github both 
//don't upload small changes to github evertime for a project.
//dont do such things when necessary then only do commit.
//check our project is modified or not ?
command:git status
//output
modified:   gitUpload/gitupload.txt
modified:   src/app.js

//to add modified files to github
command:git status
command:git add .
command:git status
command:git commit -m "add files"
command:git push
